# CollBeet Assistant

CollBeet Assistant is a Google Action designed to work as a personal companion for college students. It will keep track of student essentials such as daily lecture schedules, canteen schedules and daily announcements. It automatically detects user's time and responds accordingly. Other than that, CollBeet Assistant can also be setup to let students know directions to different locations around the campus such as different staffrooms, labs, Principal office, Admin office, Auditorium etc and basic college info such as college website, address and phone number. Adding data to CollBeet Assistant is easy due to [CollBeet Admin](https://github.com/kalol-institute-of-technology/CollBeet-Admin/), a dashboard interface which lets Administrators manage, add and update data in realtime for entire college super quickly and easily. Since it is a completely open source project, feel free to use CollBeet Assistant to create a fully customised Conversational AI, that best suits your college need.

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js and NPM
2. Install the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/)
3. CollBeet Admin
4. GCP Account with Billing Enabled

---

## Deployment

**Note: Before proceeding, make sure you have [CollBeet Admin](https://github.com/kalol-institute-of-technology/CollBeet-Admin) up and running on a server.**

---

### Setup Project and Agent

1. Clone this repo on to your local machine using following command.

      `git clone https://github.com/kalol-institute-of-technology/CollBeet-Assistant`

1. Open the [Actions Console](https://console.actions.google.com/).

1. Click **New project**.

1. Type in a **Project name**. This name is for your own internal reference; later on, you can set an external name for your project.

1. Click **Create Project**.

1. Rather than pick a category, scroll down to the More options section and click the **Conversational card**.

1. Click **Build your Action** to expand the options and select **Add Action(s)**.

1. Click **Add your first Action**.

1. On the **Custom intent** dialog, click **Build** to launch the Dialogflow console.

1. Click **Create**.

1. Click the gear icon on the left navigation.

1. Click **Export and Import**.

1. Click **Restore From Zip**.

1. **Upload** the `CollBeetAssistantAgent.zip` file from cloned repo folder.

1. Type **"RESTORE"** and click the **Restore** button.

1. Click **Done**

---

### Deploy your fulfillment

Now that your Actions project and Dialogflow agent are ready, do the following to deploy your local index.js file using the Firebase Functions CLI:

1. In a **terminal**, navigate to the **/functions** directory of your base files clone.

1. Using the Actions project ID, run the following command:

        firebase use --project <PROJECT_ID>

1. **Run** the following command in the terminal to **install dependencies**.

        npm install

1. **Setup** Environemental Variables. You will require **Server URL** of deployed CollBeet Admin Server, once you have that **run** the following command:

        firebase functions:config:set envariables.server_url="<SERVER_URL>" --project <PROJECT_ID>
        
   **For example:** If your custom domain is `https://collbeet.test`, you need to **run** the following command:
 
         firebase functions:config:set envariables.server_url="https://collbeet.test"     
         
1. Go the the **index.js** file and personalise the phrase `Welcome to CollBeet Assistant. How can I help you?.` in **Default Welcome Intent**. **Save** the file. **Note**: Can be done later also. Pesonalise means replace the name `CollBeet Assistant` with your action/companion name.
        
1. **Run** the following command in the terminal to deploy your webhook to Firebase.

        firebase deploy --project <PROJECT_ID>
        
After a few minutes, you should see **"Deploy complete!"** indicating that you've successfully deployed your webhook to Firebase. Make sure you have the [billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) enabled with the project used by your Action on GCP else external network will not be accessible and your action will not be able to retrieve data from CollBeet Admin.

---

### Retrieve the deployment URL

1. Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

1. Select your **Actions project** from the list of options.

1. Navigate to **Develop > Functions** on the left navigation bar. If you're prompted to **"Choose data sharing settings"**, you can ignore this option by clicking Do this later.

1. Under the **Dashboard** tab, you should see an entry for **"dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment"** with a URL under Trigger. **Copy this URL**.

---

### Set the URL in Dialogflow

1. Open the **Dialogflow console**.

1. Navigate to **Fulfillment** on the left navigation.

1. Enable **Webhook**.

1. **Paste the URL** you copied from the Firebase dashboard if it doesn't already appear.

1. Click **Save**.

---

If followed correctly CollBeet Assistant should be deployed now. If you are facing errors, definitely check your [logs](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs) to know exactly what error you have been facing. If logs are not showing up, click on **Resources Drop Down Menu** below `Filter by label or text search` textfield, and select **Cloud Function** > **dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment** > **All Region**
